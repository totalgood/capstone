{"name":"Capstone","tagline":"PDX Code Guild - Capstone Project - Neural Net based Digit Guesser","body":"# finnegan\r\n## by Cole Howard\r\n\r\nA custom neural net with a serious nod to [I Am Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/) for recoginzing handwritten digits.  The neural net is pre-trained on the MNIST dataset (run on an AWS instance).  And the user input is rescaled and tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- Correct button layout\r\n- Add option to enter correct value (on an incorrect guess), to collect specific data on accuracy\r\n- Visualizations of each layer of the net (in d3 or bokeh)\r\n- Provide a selection of neural net architectures to allow a user to swap out and see the different vizualations and results.  (Results data will be stored by specific architecture.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## To Get Started\r\n\r\nNavigate to: [Finnegan](https:uglyboxer.pythonanywhere.com)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe baseline architecture for the net is at [Github](http://uglyboxer.github.io/finnegan/)\r\n\r\nTo adjust hyper-parameters or choose dataset:\r\nOpen net_launch.py and adjust as needed at the bottom of the file.  The dataset can be switched by commenting out the appropriate line at the bottom and uncommneting the other.  Or simply:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom Network import network\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd feed it the appropriate parameters.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
