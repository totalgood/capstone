{"name":"Capstone","tagline":"PDX Code Guild - Capstone Project - Neural Net based Digit Guesser","body":"# finnegan\r\n## by Cole Howard\r\n\r\nA custom neural net for recoginzing handwritten digits, with a serious nod to [I Am Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/).  The neural net is pre-trained on the MNIST dataset (run on an AWS instance).  And the user input is rescaled and tested.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uglyboxer/capstone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uglyboxer/capstone) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/capstone/badge/?version=latest)](http://capstone.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest)\r\n\r\n\r\nsketch.js is a library created by [Michael Bleigh](http://intridea.github.io/sketch.js/) to allow the user to draw the image of a digit.  It has been modified to pull a drawn image from the page before being resized and sent to the neural network for classifaciton.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- Analize Results\r\n- Analize correlation of misclassification and actual numbers (7's tend to be classified as 2, etc.)\r\n- Train net on rotated images for more robust recognition\r\n- Visualizations of each layer of the net (in d3 or bokeh)\r\n- Provide a selection of neural net architectures to allow a user to swap out and see the different vizualations and results.  (Results data will be stored by specific architecture.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## To Get Started\r\n\r\nNavigate to: [Finnegan](https:uglyboxer.pythonanywhere.com)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe baseline architecture for the net is on Github, [here](http://uglyboxer.github.io/finnegan/), and the code for the webapp (including Finnegan) be found [here](https://github.com/uglyboxer/capstone).\r\n\r\nFull documentation hosted [here](http://capstone.rtfd.org)\r\n\r\nTo adjust hyper-parameters or choose dataset:\r\nOpen net_launch.py and adjust as needed at the bottom of the file.  The dataset can be switched by commenting out the appropriate line at the bottom and uncommneting the other.  Or simply:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom Network import network\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd feed it the appropriate parameters.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
